# PythonExercises
My solutions for the Python exercises from www.practicepython.org 

The solutions are in the scripts folder!

This repository includes a Python Virtual Environment.
Just clone the repository, "cd" into the bin folder and run:

source activate

From that moment on you should be good to go.
